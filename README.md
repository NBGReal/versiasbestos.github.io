# VersiAsbestos
*Welcome to VersiAsbestos! Buy the best totally legal white powder, now in different flavours.*
## Purpose
This repository is an on-going side project for learning and practicing HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript (and potentially other backend languages). The website is hosted
using GitHub pages and is a satirical website for a fictional white poweder chain, [VersiAsbestos](https://symbadx37.github.io/). This project was first started back in April 2024 and was later moved to GitHub in early October. If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the repo and/or make a pull request.
# Version History
The full changelogs for all release versions are listed below in addition to the original commit date. Since I'm using GitHub pages instead of using the built-in 'Releases' feature (since this repository is pure HTML and CSS), this README is the primary way I'm documenting development changes.
## Patch v0.1
- Start of fork and removing of Quinton's branding process
